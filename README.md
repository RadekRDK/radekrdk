You somehow managed to find my personal GitHub page. Cool!

# About Me

Currently, I am an aspiring software developer with a Bachelor's degree in CS attained just recently.

Although everything I write is by myself, considering my often robotic, emotionally cold way of intonation, you'll probably mistake me for a LLM anyways.

# What I Do

Although I am most focused on full-stack web application development, I am currently in a jack of all trades master of none situation and trying to make the best out of it.

Compared to many other much fancier GitHub profiles with the special personal repository, not much is happening here at the moment.
I keep this mostly as an archive for old test projects, as well as some of the pet projects I developed for fun, though there is a high chance that they are all private at the moment. Considering I display my contribution history for those repos as well, I hope you will still believe me that I am a really good programmer who is really creative, does a lot of things and always totally knows what he is doing.
