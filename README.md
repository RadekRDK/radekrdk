You somehow managed to find my personal GitHub page. Cool!

# About Me

Currently, I am an aspiring software developer with a CS degree attained just recently.

I feel deep interest in many different areas of software development, including full-stack web applications, mobile apps, local desktop applications, computer graphics, and video games. Some may admire me for such a broad spectrum of interests, while others may see this as a jack of all trades master of none situation.

Although everything I write is by myself, considering my often robotic, emotionally cold way of conveying my thoughts, you'll probably mistake me for a LLM anyways.

# What I Do

Compared to many other much fancier GitHub profiles with the special personal repository, not much is happening here at the moment.
I use my profile mostly as an archive of old test projects, as well as some of the hobby side projects I have developed for fun, though there is a high chance that they are all private at the moment. Considering I display my contribution history for those repos as well, I hope you will still believe me that I am a really good programmer who is really creative, does a lot of things and always totally knows what he is doing.
