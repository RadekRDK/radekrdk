You somehow managed to find my personal GitHub page. Cool!

# About Me

I am an aspiring software developer who found out in the past that solving problems through algorithms is my favorite thing to do. So what else is there left other than to turn this into my profession?

I feel deep interest in many different areas of software development, including full-stack web applications, local desktop applications, computer graphics, and video games. Some may admire me for such a broad spectrum of interests, while others may see this as an unfortunate jack of all trades master of none situation.

Although everything I write is by myself, considering my often robotic, emotionally cold way of conveying my thoughts, you'll probably mistake me for a LLM anyways.

# What I Do

Compared to many other much fancier GitHub profiles, not much is happening here at the moment.
I use my profile mostly as an archive of old demo projects, as well as some of the hobby side projects I have developed for fun, though there is a high chance that they are all private at the moment. Considering I display my contribution history for those repos as well, I hope you will still believe me that I am a really good programmer who is really creative, does a lot of things and always totally knows what he is doing.
